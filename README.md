# REPO-merging
a guide of a way to merge 2 repos owned by the same person

i followed a template of sort from the folloowing website
https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-merge-two-repositories-on-git-b0ed5e3b4448

This might also be a little helpful if you are working on components of the project on a separate repo while you work on the template files of the same project and all in a different repo and finally want to merge the two.
(Make sure you aren’t merging two very “worlds-apart” project to build a hybrid project, that’s just stupid)
