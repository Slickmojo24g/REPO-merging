Step 1: Clone one of the repositories (say repo1).

git clone <https/ssh-link-for-repo1>


Step 2: Create another remote in this clone which points to repo2-our second repository.

git remote add <your-custom-remote-name> <https/ssh-for-repo2>


Now you will have the following remotes

origin <repo-1-link> (fetch)
origin <repo-1-link> (push)
your-custom-remote-name <repo-2-link> (fetch)
your-custom-remote-name <repo-2-link> (push)
